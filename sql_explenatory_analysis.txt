-- 1) Data Exploration:

-- 2) Exploring Seasonality:

-- Seasonality by month
WITH t AS

	SELECT 
	DATE_PART('month',end_of_period) as cohort_month, 
	DATE_PART('year',end_of_period) AS cohort_year, *
	FROM customer_happiness_cohorts
	WHERE type = 'tradesman'
	) 
SELECT cohort_month, AVG(net_promoter_score) as monthly_average_score 
FROM t
GROUP BY cohort_month
ORDER BY monthly_average_score 
;

-- Seasonality by year and month
WITH t AS 
	(
	SELECT 
	DATE_PART('month',end_of_period) as cohort_month, 
	DATE_PART('year',end_of_period) AS cohort_year, *
	FROM customer_happiness_cohorts
	WHERE type = 'tradesman'
	) 
SELECT cohort_year, cohort_month, AVG(net_promoter_score) as monthly_average_score 
FROM t
GROUP BY cohort_month, cohort_year
ORDER BY cohort_year, monthly_average_score DESC
;

-- Seasonality by year and quarter
WITH t AS 
	(
	SELECT 
	DATE_PART('quarter',end_of_period) as cohort_quarter, 
	DATE_PART('year',end_of_period) AS cohort_year,*
	FROM customer_happiness_cohorts
	WHERE type = 'tradesman'
	) 
SELECT cohort_year, cohort_quarter, AVG(net_promoter_score) as quarterly_average_score 
FROM t
GROUP BY cohort_year,cohort_quarter
ORDER BY quarterly_average_score DESC
;

-- ratio-to-moving average method using window function on year and quarter separate

WITH final_table AS (

		WITH mid_table AS 
			( 
			SELECT cohort_year, cohort_quarter, AVG(net_promoter_score) as quarterly_average_score 
			FROM 
				(SELECT 
				DATE_PART('quarter',end_of_period) as cohort_quarter, 
				DATE_PART('year',end_of_period) AS cohort_year,*
				FROM customer_happiness_cohorts
				WHERE type = 'tradesman') t
			GROUP BY cohort_year,cohort_quarter
			ORDER BY quarterly_average_score DESC
			) 
			SELECT 
				cohort_year,cohort_quarter, 
				quarterly_average_score, 
				AVG(quarterly_average_score) OVER (order by cohort_year, cohort_quarter rows between 1 preceding and 2 following) as moving_average 
			FROM mid_table
			order by cohort_year, cohort_quarter asc
			)
SELECT 
	cohort_year,cohort_quarter, 
	quarterly_average_score/moving_average
	AS seasonal_index 
FROM final_table
ORDER BY seasonal_index DESC
;

-- Results:

-- The final_table shows the seasonality index of NPS for each quarter. 
-- An index abobe 1 means that the quarter has a performance higher than average trend, while an index below 1 shows the opposite, which means the quarter performed below average trend.

-- As we can see from the final_table the best performing quarters in terms of NPS are Q3 and Q4, consistently over the years. Q2 is consistently scoring an NPS average trend in the middle over the years, while Q1 has been the low performing quarter across all years.

-- We can thereore conclude that there is a clear seasonality effect in the data, with NPS going down in the first Q1 and then progressivly going up until reaching its max on Q3 and Q4.

-- Interpretation:

-- HP 1) 
---The majority of home works/constructions works and renovations tend to be done during the summer period. Treadsmen are happier when there are higher volumes of works, and tend to be less happy when volumes are lower. This can be related to the pricing model used by mybuild.com. In times of relative scarsity of jobs tradesmen are more likely to be shortlisted but not einding up winning the work, as opposed to period when there is an abundance of work. This can be one of the main reasons for treadsmen being less happier during Q1 and Q2.

-- Validating HP1): I would need to show that in Q3 and Q4 volume of jobs on the platform is usually lower, but I do not have that data. the information that I have on the different cohorts is: locations, tradesmen_feedback, tradesman_last_interest and trademens_trade.

-- HP 2) Tradesmen tend to give lower NPS if they are getting on average lower ratings.
	-- A) check if tredsman with lower ratings tend to give lower score
	-- B) Check if tredsman in Q1 tend to have lower ratings.


SELECT * 
FROM tradesmen_feedback
LIMIT 10

--- 2) Marketing wants to run campaing to get more treadsmen. Given NPS data, which types and locations should they focus on?
-- for this I would look at the locations and trades with Lower NPS score. We can assume that in those segments WOM is not going to be as effective as in other segments, therefore the recommendation is to focus spending on those segments to maximise return.
